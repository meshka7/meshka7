# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Viktor  

**QA Analyst | Future AI/ML Engineer**  

I started my career in **technical and customer support**, but now Iâ€™m building a strong foundation in **Software Quality Assurance** and gradually transitioning into **AI/ML Engineering**.  

### Currently I:  
- Work as a **QA Analyst** on AI-driven projects (voicebots, chatbots, AI scoring, RAG systems).  
- Build expertise in **manual and automated testing**, while learning **Python** for QA automation and AI projects.  
- Develop skills in **QA**, **API testing**, and **test design for AI features**.  
- Run personal projects like **Registration Bot** to learn how to build and validate real AI agents.  

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:** become a **QA+AI Engineer hybrid**, someone who not only tests but also shapes the quality of AI systems end-to-end.
